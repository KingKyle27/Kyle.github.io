        <h1>My Passion for Art</h1>
        <br />
        <h2>I enjoy finding elements of art in the beautiful world around me that God has created. I espesially am in awe of nature; it's mesmorizing to view and is just jaw-dropping. I like to base many of my art pieces off of photos of nature or portray the elements that I know make up classic landscapes</h2>
