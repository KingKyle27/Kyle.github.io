        <h1>My Passion for Art</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>I enjoy sketching and painting to my heart's desire. I also love finding elements of art in the beautiful world around me that God has created. I especially am in awe of nature; it's mesmerizing to view and is just jaw-dropping. I like to get inspiration for many of my art pieces from photos of nature or portray the elements that I know make up classic landscapes. </p>
